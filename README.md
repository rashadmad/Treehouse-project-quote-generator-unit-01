# Treehouse-project-quote-generator-unit-01
Treehouse project that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.

## Instructions
For this first project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc.

### example
>"Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - _Patrick McKenzie_ 

You'll locate and select your own quotes. Please select tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes, for the sake of this project. Thank you.

You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:

* Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
* Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice basic JavaScript skills while also creating a simple interactive portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

After completing this project, you'll have a tremendous sense of accomplishment, an awesome example of your hard work to show off, and you'll be one important step closer to your goals. Best of luck and happy coding!
